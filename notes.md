# Introduction to machine learning

## History of machine learning


### Brief history of AI and ML 

- 'Electro' - robot from Westinghouse

- Talos - greek mythology, automaton

- Original computer programmers - manual switches and wiring

- Alan Turing - Automatic Computing Engine

- Turing - "Can machines think?"
 - Imitiation game/Turing test
 
- First Artificial intellegence program: Newell, Simon, 1955
 - Logic theory machine
 
- Early proposal for questions in "Artifiical Intelligence"
 - Automatic computers
 - How can a computer be programmed to use a language
 - Neuron nets: mimic the brain
 - Theory size of a calcualtion
 - Self-improvement
 - Abstraction
 - Randomness and creativity
 
Theorem: the past explains the present and gives us some intuition about the future

### Difference between AI, ML, statistics and data science

Arthur Samuel: Pioneer of computer gaming
 - Made program that plays checkers
 - Demonstrated reinforcement learning
 
#### Data science and Machine learning

Both: 


 - Uses computing power
 - Usually large sets of data
 - Lots of math

Data science:

 - Analyse the data to draw conclusions
 
 
Machine learning:

 - Attempts to perform tasks without explicit instructions
 
#### Artificial intelligence

Topics in AI include:

 - Expert systems
 - Speech
 - Natural language processing
 - Vision
 - Machine learning
 - Neural networks
 - Robotics

Common theme is building systems that figure things out on their own, or at least simulate that ability

#### Machine learning

Topics:

 - Ensemble
 - Reinforcement
 - Supervised
 - Unsupervised
 - Semi-supervised
 - More to come....
 
#### Machine learning models

What is a model?  Taking a problem or challenge as described by lots of data, adding a machine learning algortihm and, through computation, trying to digure out a mathematical formula that can accurately generalize about that problem.

Algorithm: 

 - unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems
 - Set of steps to follow to solve a specific problem
 - Intended to be repeatable with the same outcome

Heuristic:

 - A mental shortcut or 'rule of thumb' that proivides guidance on a task
 - Does not guarantee a consistent outcome
 
Example: troubleshooting why a computer doesn't work

Algorithm - set of steps that you can take to narrow down to the cause

Heuristic - educated guess 

Sometimes, we use heuristics because we just want a (cheap) answer that is 'good enough', rather than an (expensive) answer that is perfect
